## To use

Your local IP address must be added to the Facebook App ID I have set up, or you can set up your own at https://developers.facebook.com and change the appID in index.html. You can revoke app settings at https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=applications

There are several simple server implementations included. Start a server with one of the following:

### Node

```sh
npm install
node server.js
```

### Python

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
python server.py
```
